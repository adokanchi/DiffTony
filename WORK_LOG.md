Worked with Isha and settled on a tabulation algorithm where, when choosing to add a letter, we consider both including and excluding that letter. Excluding the letter doesn't change the max length, and including the letter involves looking at a smaller version of the problem. |

Did it on a different machine where I haven't set up the tests, so just committing now so I can pull from my laptop and run the tests. |

But now, out of the five test cases, I'm getting one correct value, three incorrect values, and an index out of bounds error. No clue what's causing that, have to investigate more another day. |

There are still definitely speedups possible though. The most obvious place is cutting down on the linear-time search for the last instance of a character in doc1. I also suspect a memoization approach could be faster here because it seems like it could cut down on the number of calls, potentially. Have to test. |

It is a good bit faster, but unfortunately, the right single quotation mark character converts to the number 8217, so I need 8218 lists, which is tough on memory. I could add a statement that explicitly tests for this case to save memory, but I don't feel like doing it at this exact moment, so I'll do it later. |

No major algorithmic changes. |
| Feb 26  |   9:10-9:38am   | In-class discussion and work about how to get rid of the binary search thing that's making the algorith O(mnlogn) instead of O(mn). Drew out a diagram on the board and realized that if doc1.charAt(i)==doc2.charAt(j) then dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] because you have the same longest substring with that extra last character included. Otherwise, the substring can't be made any longer, and you just use the max of the previous two cases. Works and is significantly faster at O(mn). Next steps would be to cut down the space requirement from O(mn) to O(m) by only using two arrays instead of a mxn 2d array, then trying to find the strings themselves. |
