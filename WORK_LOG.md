Worked with Isha and settled on a tabulation algorithm where, when choosing to add a letter, we consider both including and excluding that letter. Excluding the letter doesn't change the max length, and including the letter involves looking at a smaller version of the problem. |

Did it on a different machine where I haven't set up the tests, so just committing now so I can pull from my laptop and run the tests. |

But now, out of the five test cases, I'm getting one correct value, three incorrect values, and an index out of bounds error. No clue what's causing that, have to investigate more another day. |
| Feb 24  |   9-9:10am    | I was checking the wrong document to determine the index... changed a 2 to a 1 in the code and everything works. There are still definitely speedups possible though. The most obvious place is cutting down on the linear-time search for the last instance of a character in doc1. I also suspect a memoization approach could be faster here because it seems like it could cut down on the number of calls, potentially. Have to test. |
