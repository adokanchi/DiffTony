Worked with Isha and settled on a tabulation algorithm where, when choosing to add a letter, we consider both including and excluding that letter. Excluding the letter doesn't change the max length, and including the letter involves looking at a smaller version of the problem. |

Did it on a different machine where I haven't set up the tests, so just committing now so I can pull from my laptop and run the tests. |

But now, out of the five test cases, I'm getting one correct value, three incorrect values, and an index out of bounds error. No clue what's causing that, have to investigate more another day. |

There are still definitely speedups possible though. The most obvious place is cutting down on the linear-time search for the last instance of a character in doc1. I also suspect a memoization approach could be faster here because it seems like it could cut down on the number of calls, potentially. Have to test. |
| Feb 25  |  10:45-11:00am  | Added the speedup I thought of in class where we store the locations of every instance of each character in a list and do binary search so we can find the locations in O(logn) time instead of O(n). It is a good bit faster, but unfortunately, the right single quotation mark character converts to the number 8217, so I need 8218 lists, which is tough on memory. I could add a statement that explicitly tests for this case to save memory, but I don't feel like doing it at this exact moment, so I'll do it later. |

No major algorithmic changes. |
