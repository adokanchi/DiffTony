| April 5 |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Feb 24  | 11:15-11:55am | In-class discussions about algorithm design. Worked with Isha and settled on a tabulation algorithm where, when choosing to add a letter, we consider both including and excluding that letter. Excluding the letter doesn't change the max length, and including the letter involves looking at a smaller version of the problem. |

Did it on a different machine where I haven't set up the tests, so just committing now so I can pull from my laptop and run the tests. |

But now, out of the five test cases, I'm getting one correct value, three incorrect values, and an index out of bounds error. No clue what's causing that, have to investigate more another day. |
